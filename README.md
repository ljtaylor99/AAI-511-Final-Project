# AAI-511-Final-Project
This repository contains the code and report for the Final Project for USD course AAI 511: Neural Networks and Deep Learning. 

** Project Abstract **

Long-short memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structures have both been used for music classification tasks. However, there is a lack of literature weighing the merits of both models relative to each other. In our project, we aim to help bridge the gap in the literature by comparing the two models. A dataset consisting of 369 MIDI files from 9 different classical composers was used. The LSTM model obtained an 89% accuracy while the CNN model achieved an 87% accuracy. These results stand in contrast to similar comparative work and raise important questions for future research.
