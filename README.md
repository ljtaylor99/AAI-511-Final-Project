# AAI-511-Final-Project
This repository contains the code and report for the Final Project for USD course AAI 511: Neural Networks and Deep Learning. In this group project we compared the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks in classifying classical music according to composer. Overall our results indicated that the LSTM network had better performance. 

 For details about implementation, refer to the project report and code.
